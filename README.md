## ⚡️ Features

_Creates evenly sized empty buffers on each side of your focused buffer, which acts as padding for your window._

- Plug and play, no configuration required
- Seamless experience with your workflow.
- Multiple tabs support
- [Highly customizable experience](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim#configuration)
- [Support split/vsplit windows](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim/wiki/Showcase#window-layout-support)
- [Built-in scratchPad feature](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim/wiki/Showcase#side-buffer-as-scratch-pad)
- [Themed side buffers](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim/wiki/Showcase#custom-background-color)
- Fully integrates with file trees ([neo-tree.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim), [nvim-tree.lua](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua), etc.) and dashboard ([alpha-nvim](https://github.com/goolord/alpha-nvim), [snacks.nvim](https://github.com/folke/snacks.nvim), etc.)
- Neovim >= 0.9 compatibility
    - 0.7 and 0.8 support is still available in the [1.x frozen version](https://github.com/shortcuts/no-neck-pain.nvim/tree/1.x)

## 🎭 Motivations

Although there's other (amazing!) alternatives that provide a zen-distraction-free-center mode, they usually make assumptions that might alter your workflow, or at least require some configuration to suit your needs.

`no-neck-pain.nvim` aims at providing a seamless non-opinionated buffer centering experience, while being super customizable.
