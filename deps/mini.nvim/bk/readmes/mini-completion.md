### Autocompletion and signature help plugin

- Async (with customizable 'debounce' delay) 'two-stage chain completion': first builtin LSP, then configurable fallback.
- Has functionality for completion item info and function signature (both in floating window appearing after customizable delay).

See more details in [Features](#features) and [help file](../doc/mini-completion.txt).

## Features

- Two-stage chain completion:
    - First stage is an LSP completion. Supports `additionalTextEdits`, like auto-import and others.
    - If first stage is not set up or resulted into no candidates, fallback action is executed. The most tested actions are Neovim's built-in insert completion.
- Automatic display in floating window of completion item info (via 'completionItem/resolve' request) and signature help (with highlighting of active parameter if LSP server provides such information).
- Automatic actions are done after some configurable amount of delay. This reduces computational load and allows fast typing (completion and signature help) and item selection (item info)
- User can force two-stage completion via or fallback completion.

## Installation

This plugin can be installed as part of 'mini.nvim' library (**recommended**) or as a standalone Git repository.

There are two branches to install from:

- `main` (default, **recommended**) will have latest development version of plugin. All changes since last stable release should be perceived as being in beta testing phase (meaning they already passed alpha-testing and are moderately settled).
- `stable` will be updated only upon releases with code tested during public beta-testing phase in `main` branch.

Here are code snippets for some common installation methods (use only one):

- Using [wbthomason/packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Github repo</th>
            <th>Branch</th> <th>Code snippet</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>'mini.nvim' library</td>
            <td>Main</td> <td><code>use 'echasnovski/mini.nvim'</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stable</td> <td><code>use { 'echasnovski/mini.nvim', branch = 'stable' }</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>Standalone plugin</td> <td>Main</td> <td><code>use 'echasnovski/mini.completion'</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stable</td> <td><code>use { 'echasnovski/mini.completion', branch = 'stable' }</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

- Using [junegunn/vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug):

<table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>Github repo</th>
            <th>Branch</th> <th>Code snippet</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>'mini.nvim' library</td>
            <td>Main</td> <td><code>Plug 'echasnovski/mini.nvim'</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stable</td> <td><code>Plug 'echasnovski/mini.nvim', { 'branch': 'stable' }</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td rowspan=2>Standalone plugin</td> <td>Main</td> <td><code>Plug 'echasnovski/mini.completion'</code></td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Stable</td> <td><code>Plug 'echasnovski/mini.completion', { 'branch': 'stable' }</code></td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

**Important**: don't forget to call `require('mini.completion').setup()` to enable its functionality.

**Note**: if you are on Windows, there might be problems with too long file paths (like `error: unable to create file <some file name>: Filename too long`). Try doing one of the following:
- Enable corresponding git global config value: `git config --system core.longpaths true`. Then try to reinstall.
- Install plugin in other place with shorter path.

## Default config

```lua
-- No need to copy this inside `setup()`. Will be used automatically.
{
  -- Delay (debounce type, in ms) between certain Neovim event and action.
  -- This can be used to (virtually) disable certain automatic actions by
  -- setting very high delay time (like 10^7).
  delay = { completion = 100, info = 100, signature = 50 },

  -- Maximum dimensions of floating windows for certain actions. Action
  -- entry should be a table with 'height' and 'width' fields.
  window_dimensions = {
    info = { height = 25, width = 80 },
    signature = { height = 25, width = 80 },
  },

  -- Way of how module does LSP completion
  lsp_completion = {
    -- `source_func` should be one of 'completefunc' or 'omnifunc'.
    source_func = 'completefunc',

    -- `auto_setup` should be boolean indicating if LSP completion is set up
    -- on every `BufEnter` event.
    auto_setup = true,

    -- `process_items` should be a function which takes LSP
    -- 'textDocument/completion' response items and word to complete. Its
    -- output should be a table of the same nature as input items. The most
    -- common use-cases are custom filtering and sorting. You can use
    -- default `process_items` as `MiniCompletion.default_process_items()`.
    process_items = --<function: filters out snippets; sorts by LSP specs>,
  },

  -- Fallback action. It will always be run in Insert mode. To use Neovim's
  -- built-in completion (see `:h ins-completion`), supply its mapping as
  -- string. Example: to use 'whole lines' completion, supply '<C-x><C-l>'.
  fallback_action = --<function: like `<C-n>` completion>,

  -- Module mappings. Use `''` (empty string) to disable one. Some of them
  -- might conflict with system mappings.
  mappings = {
    force_twostep = '<C-Space>', -- Force two-step completion
    force_fallback = '<A-Space>', -- Force fallback completion
  },

  -- Whether to set Vim's settings for better experience (modifies
  -- `shortmess` and `completeopt`)
  set_vim_settings = true,
}
```
